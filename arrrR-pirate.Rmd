#####Here is a haiku about numbers.
Chris- take it away!  
Write a good number poem  
Like two plus forty  

## Cha Cha Cha Changes
one out of five tries
leads to success only sometimes
we have more to learn


##NYC flights
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13) #install.packages("nycflights13")

flights

#Jan 1 data
flights %>% 
  filter(month == 1,
         day == 1)
```
